- **bug**: You've found a bug when using brsHamcrest and wish to report it (See **Reporting Bugs**)
- **question**: You have a question about brsHamcrest
- **enhancement**: You have an idea about a new feature or improvement

Make sure to search existing Issues to see if your query has already been addressed.

If you are creating an Issue labeled as a **bug**, then please include the following information:
- **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
- **Motivation or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you. Perhaps provide a snippet of the code you are trying to execute.
- **brsHamcrest Version(s)** - is it a regression?
- **Roku Device Model and Firmware Version** - is this a problem with all Roku Devices?
- **Steps to Reproduce** - provide an example or an unambiguous set of steps.

## Contributing Source Code
Contributions should be handled by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) brsHamcrest, creating commits and then creating a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the original repository. All Pull Requests should be to merge into the `develop` branch.

Pull Request comments and commit messages should [properly reference](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) any Issues the Pull Request closes. There is a good [GitHub Blog entry](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) showing an example.
